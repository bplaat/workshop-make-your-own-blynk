# Workshop Make your own Blynk
This is a workshop that shows you how you can create your own small IoT system with an ESP8266, a simple website client and a Node.js backend server

## The two projects
In this workshop we are going to create two different projects:
- The first project is a realtime system to control a LED on our ESP with a button on a website
- The second project is a simple weather station that uses a DHT sensor with and our ESP to send measurements to a server which are then displayed on our website in a realtime chart
